# klsmith/nginx-phpfpm

A reliable, highly-configurable nginx + php-fpm web server, available for PHP 5.6 and 7.1.

## Simple Example

Run the following in the command line:

```
docker run -d -p 8080:80 -e NGINX_ENABLE_AUTH=false klsmith/nginx-phpfpm:5.6-fpm
```

Point your browser to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080). You should see [a simple "Hello world!" page](#hello-world) that notes the container hostname and any environment variables.

## Hello world!

The single "Hello world!" `index.php` in this image is used to show a given container is working properly, and it's borrowed and heavily modified from [Docker Cloud's hello-world](https://github.com/docker/dockercloud-hello-world).
